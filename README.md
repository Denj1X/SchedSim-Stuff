A Scheduling Algorithm is the algorithm which tells us how much 
    CPU time we can allocate to the processes. These scheduling algorithms 
    are either preemptive or non-preemptive. 
    
This particular one simulates 5 of the most popular schedule algorithms: 
    Round-Robin
    FCFS
    Priority Scheduling
    SJN (Shortest-Job-Next)
    SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)
